# Week-2
## NASA GIS Temperature Data Visualization

1. What are your x- and y-axes?
In this plot, X-axis represents a wide range of years in decades from 1800 to 2010. 
Y-axis represents the deviations in temperature from -40 to 80 in degrees.

2. Did you use a subset of the data? If so, what was it?
Yes, I had used only 4 columns of data from the dataset whose names are 'Year', 'Globe', 'NHem'(Northern Hemisphere) and 'SHem'(Southern Hemisphere). 

3. Are there any particular aspects of your visualization to which you would like to bring attention?
I represented the 'Globe' line chart by using a red line and square marker on it, 'North Hemisphere' line chart using 
a green line and star mark on it, 'South Hemisphere' line chart using a blue line and circle marker on it. 
If you observe clearly, you can see at some points that all lines are getting collided(intersecting points), 
i.e. Deviations in temperatures are same on Globe, North hemisphere and South hemisphere during some years.

4. What do you think the data and your visualization show?
From this visualization of GISTEMP data provided by NASA, We can clearly depict that there is a rise in global temperatures year by year. 
Especially this growth can be seen clearly from 1970 to 2010 with some upfalls and downfalls.
